1. Not enough contrast and it is affect readability. Still unclear why there are  instructions. Yes, first is more topic description, bt it is unclear because of lack of contrast and hierarchy;
**Potential solution:** fix sapcing for contrast and => clarity, + add hierarchy to typography;
2. As a user I don't understand, where I am, is it a challenge is it a task, I don't understand structure; I don't understand, how to go back and where the list of challenges; users need to feel control, it makes them feel calm and safe; solution: the simpliest fix is to add breadcrumbs;
3. Helping icon should be smaller to not compete with other components;
4. Tooltip is not contrast enough, its' content is too wordy; solution: add shadow/color to tooltip component, rethink text:

5. Buttons on the different levels;
6. "Start over" button remove all results, or only for current exercise? It should be clearly eplained in dialog:

For example: "Are you sure you want to clear results of all your progress and start from the beggining?"
7. Steps is too small and light to be helpful; it is an important information, but now it is just visual noise; solution is to make stepper more prominant;

Right side input section:
1. Becauase there is no any hierarchy and contrast in text, it doesn't catch my attention and potentially useful information doesn't work:

2. Making everything with capital letter doesnâ€™t attract extra attention but create cognitive load;
3. "Form you test" is hard to understand what does it mean;
4. Helpful will be to make the whole component contrast to the layout: it will improve readability and flow understanding:
